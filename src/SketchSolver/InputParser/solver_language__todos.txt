For meeting:
    1. Sketch frontend is optimizing out any functions not used by a harness.
    2. What is the replace map?
    3. Raise issue about
            bit one = 1;
            assert(program(num_bools, bools) == one);
        vs
            assert(program(num_bools, bools) == 1);

     4. ASK ABOUT
           void NodeEvaluator::visit( TUPLE_CREATE_node &node){

           	int sz = node.nparents();
           	cptuple* cpv = new cptuple(sz);
           	if(tuplevalues[node.id] != NULL){
           		delete tuplevalues[node.id];
           	}
           	tuplevalues[node.id] = cpv;
               Tuple* otp = (Tuple*)node.getOtype();
           	for(int t=0; t<sz; ++t){
                   OutType* e = otp->entries[t];
                   if(e==OutType::INT || e==OutType::BOOL || e->isTuple) {
                     cpv->vv[t] = i(*node.get_parent(t));
                   } else {
                     cpv->vv[t] = (node.get_parent(t)->id);
                   }
           	}
           	setbn(node, node.id );// <<<<<<<<<<<<<< HERE WHY node.id rather than values[node.id]?

           }

    5. Discussion:
        What should be the semantics of replace and produce_replace?
            f.replace("dummy_program", new_program);
            should new_program be inlined in f, or should "dummy_program" be replaced with the string new_program.get_name()?
            * the names of the underlying dags, are different then the names of the variables that hold the objects in the solver language.
            How should this relate to the FunctionMapTransformerProgram and the construction of a var store.
            easiest would be to inline the dag before returning the var store.

            --it's like assign. and you actually can use it as such.

    6. Ask Armando about returning an object vs a pointer to an object.
    7. Raise concern:
        CEGISSolver returns UNSAT: ******** FAILED ********
        Leaves some holes unconcretized
        When concretizing inputs this happens
        to_concretize =
            dag sketch_main__Wrapper__id1658726__id1672757__id1672758{
                H__0_28_26_24_15_12_10_7
                1= H__0_28_26_24_15_12_10_7 !
                2= ASSERT (!H__0_28_26_24_15_12_10_7) : boolean..mplate.sk:18: Array out of bounds
                3= ASSERT H__0_28_26_24_15_12_10_7 : boolean..mplate.sk:28: Array out of bounds
            }
        This asserts false: assert((to_concretize->size() == 0) == (to_concretize->get_failed_assert() == nullptr));
        because to_concretize->get_failed_assert() == nullptr.
        TODO: fix issue where there are failing dags without failing asserts. Proposal: solve the dag again?
        TODO: handle this edge case with proper asserts. [dag].(if(|ctrls| != 0) => assert unsat).
    8. TODO: Investigate Pcond1
        Discuss about the pcond (concretize #PC to true vs leave #PC):
        proposed strategy:
            when concretizing holes, leave #PC.
            when concretizing inputs, set #PC to 1
            when solving, set #PC to 1.1
    9. Discuss: when cloning a recursive function it stops being recursive because the clone rather than pointing to itself, points to the original.
    10. setVal takes as input a size_t, is this something we should be worried about?
    11. what are -1s in controls in CegisChecker (I guess they are 'unset'?); they seem to be interpreted as 0 here: int intFromBV(T& bv, int start, int nbits)
        TODO: added that -1 and 0 are equal in ObjP:: bool operator == (const objP& other) const
    12. Can arrays be holes? Seems like only SRC can be arrays but not CTRLS. Otherwise, need to fix the tracking of original name for arrays.

For Master's thesis
1. Write thesis
    1.1. outline
    1.2. rest

Good to do
Refactor interpreter to use classes and subclasses instead of switches for different values/methods (like in SolverLanguage.h).

Medium term
0. Implement useful error/warning messages with line numbers.
1. refactor backend code to look like solver language (meaning the signatures of the functions concretize and file).
    1.1 Compile directly to Cpp rather than interpreting program
3. Implement classes
4. Allow for construction of sketches during runtime.

Other medium terms
1. Holes in solver program and meta-solver programs

Longer term
1. Implement other domains using solver language
    1.1. Karel
    1.2 compression
        1.2.1 Geometric images
        1.2.2 Timeseries
2. How to integrate with hardcoder and parallelism
    1. Have doallparis be a module.
    2. ...
